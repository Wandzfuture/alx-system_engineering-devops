# Manage the 'manage_my_process' daemon
#
# This script provides functionality to manage a daemon process named 'manage_my_process'.
# It allows starting, stopping, and restarting the daemon, and keeps track of its PID
# using a PID file (/var/run/my_process.pid).
#
# Functions:
#   - start(): Starts the daemon in the background and saves its PID to the PID file.
#   - stop(): Stops the daemon by killing its PID and removes the PID file.
#   - restart(): Restarts the daemon by stopping and then starting it.
#
# Usage:
#   ./script_name.sh {start|stop|restart}
#
# Example usage:
#   ./script_name.sh start - Starts the daemon.
#   ./script_name.sh stop - Stops the daemon.
#   ./script_name.sh restart - Restarts the daemon.

# Path to the script to manage
