# This script creates a new hosts file with modified entries for localhost and facebook.com
# It then replaces the original hosts file with the new one to change the IP resolutions
# Be cautious when running this script, as it permanently changes the IP resolutions
# Revert the changes manually by editing the /etc/hosts file if needed

# Backup the original hosts file
sudo cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.bak

# Create a new hosts file with modified entries
sudo bash -c 'echo "127.0.0.2         localhost" > /etc/hosts.new'
sudo bash -c 'echo "8.8.8.8           facebook.com" >> /etc/hosts.new'

# Replace the original hosts file with the new one
sudo mv /etc/hosts.new /etc/hosts
